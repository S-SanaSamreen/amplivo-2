class UnhandledErrorMiddleware:
    """Turns an exception that escapes the router/other middleware into a
    normal ASGI response instead of letting it reach Starlette's
    ServerErrorMiddleware.

    Starlette always wraps the whole app in an implicit ServerErrorMiddleware
    that sits OUTSIDE every middleware added via app.add_middleware() -
    including CORSMiddleware - and it's what @app.exception_handler(Exception)
    is wired to. A response built there never passes back through
    CORSMiddleware, so the browser sees a 500 with no
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin header and reports a misleading CORS error
    instead of the real one. This must be registered as the outermost
    middleware except CORS (added last, just before CORSMiddleware) so it
    still sits inside CORS and its response gets CORS headers attached.
